    "## 2-3 Search Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the previous section on Elementary Symbol Tables that the goal for symbol table implementations was $\\lg N$ for all operations. **2-3 Trees**, which are left-leaning red-black BSTs, are an old implementation to do this. They allow 1 or 2 keys per node, so there's a **2-node** (one key, two children) or a **3-node** (two keys, three children). The 2-node has two links - one to keys less than the node key and one for keys greater. The 3-node has three links - one for keys less than the smaller key, one for keys between the two keys, and one for keys greater than the larger key.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-3 trees also have **perfect balance**, so every path from the root to a null link has the same length. They also have **symmetric order** so an in-order traversal (follow left-most paths to keys)  yields the keys in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "To **insert**, you first search for the key. The easy case is if you end at a 2-node at the bottom, then you just replace that 2-node with a 3-node containing the new inserted key with what was in that 2-node, and add a null link for the third child. To insert a new key to a 3-node at the bottom, first create a temporary 4-node, then move the middle key in the 4-node into the parent. The parent becomes a 3-node, and the 2-node child is split so the children are re-linked (the smaller key becomes the new middle link of the parent and the larger key becomes the right link). If the parent were already a 3-node, it would become a temporary 4-node and that process would propagate up the tree. The only time the height of a 2-3 tree grows is when the root was a 3-node and the process reaches it, so the root has to split.\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting a 4-node is a **local** transformation - there are a constant number of operations and they don't touch the subtrees, no matter how many keys are below where the split happens. Each transformation maintains symmetric order and perfect balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tree height** worst case is $\\lg N$ (with all 2-nodes), or best case $\\log_{3} N \\approx 0.631 \\lg N$ (with all 3-nodes). This guarantees **logarithmic** performance for search and insert.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation** is complicated (see the red-black BST option below instead):\n",
    "- Maintaining multiple node types is cumbersome\n",
    "- Need multiple compares to move down the tree\n",
    "- Need to move back up the tree to split 4-nodes\n",
    "- Large number of cases for splitting"

    "## Red-Black BSTs\n",
    "\n",
    "Red-black BSTs are simple data structures that help implement 2-3 trees with very little extra code beyond the basic binary search tree. The idea is to represent a 2-3 tree as a binary search tree, and use \"internal\" left-leaning links as \"glue\" for 3-nodes. So the larger of the two keys in a 3-node will be the root in this subtree - its right link goes to keys larger than it and its left link (colored red) connects to the smaller of the two original keys. That key is now a 2-node with a left link to keys smaller and right link to keys that were between the original two keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Black links** connect 2-nodes and 3-nodes, **red links** \"glue\" nodes within a 3-node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some characteristics:\n",
    "- No node has two red links connected to it\n",
    "- Every path from the root to a null link has the same number of black links (**perfect black balance**)\n",
    "- Red links lean left\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a 1-1 correspondence of left-leaning red-black (LLRB) BSTs and 2-3 trees (think of the red links as horizontal ones, and it looks like a 2-3 tree. You can use the same search code from elementary BST, just ignore the color. It actually runs faster because of better balance. Most other operations (ceiling, selection) are also identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because each node is pointed to by precisely one link (its parent), you can encode the color of the links as data in the node (e.g. `node.left.color == 'RED'` or `node.right.color == 'BLACK'`) and null links are black."
