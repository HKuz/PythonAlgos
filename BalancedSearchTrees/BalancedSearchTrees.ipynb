    "## 2-3 Search Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the goal for symbol table implementations is $\\lg N$ for all operations. **2-3 Trees**, which are left-leaning red-black BSTs, are an old implementation to do this. They allow 1 or 2 keys per node, so there's a **2-node** (one key, two children) or a **3-node** (two keys, three children). The 2-node has two links - one to keys less than the node key and one for keys greater. The 3-node has three links - one for less, one for between, and one for greater.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-3 trees also have **perfect balance**, so every path from the root to a null link has the same length. They also have **symmetric order** so an in-order traversal (follow left-most paths to keys)  yields the keys in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "To **insert**, you first search for the key. The easy case is if you end at a 2-node at the bottom, then you just replace that 2-node with a 3-node containing the new inserted key with what was in that 2-node, and add a null link for the third child. To insert a new key to a 3-node at the bottom, first create a temporary 4-node, then move the middle key in the 4-node into the parent. The parent becomes a 3-node, and the 2-node child is split so the children are re-linked (the smaller key becomes the new middle link of the parent and the larger key becomes the right link). If the parent were already a 3-node, it would become a temporary 4-node and that process would propagate up the tree. The only time the height of a 2-3 tree grows is when the root was a 3-node and the process reaches it, so the root has to split.\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting a 4-node is a **local** transformation - there are a constant number of operations and they don't touch the subtrees, no matter how many keys are below where the split happens. Each transformation maintains symmetric order and perfect balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tree height** worst case is $\\lg N$ (with all 2-nodes), or best case $\\log_{3} N \\approx 0.631 \\lg N$ (with all 3-nodes). This guarantees **logarithmic** performance for search and insert.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation** is complicated - you could do it, but there's a better way:\n",
    "- Maintaining multiple node types is cumbersome\n",
    "- Need multiple compares to move down the tree\n",
    "- Need to move back up the tree to split 4-nodes\n",
    "- Large number of cases for splitting\n"
