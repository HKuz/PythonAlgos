    "The **sorting problem** is to re-arrange an array of $n$ items into ascending order according to a defined key which is part of the item. The goal is to sort any type of data - but how to know how to sort different types of data without knowing the type of the item's key?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **callback** is a reference to executable code. The client passes the array of objects to the `sort()` function, and the `sort()` function calls back object's `compareTo()` method as needed. In Python, you implement a callback with a first-class function.\n",

    "- Antisymmetry: if $v \\leq w$ and $w \\leq v$, then $v = w$\n",
    "- Transitivity: if $v \\leq w$ and $w \\leq x$, then $v \\leq x$\n",
    "- Totality: either $v \\leq w$ or $w \\leq v$ or both\n",

    "\n",
    "**H-sorting** looks at the array in h-length subsequences, so an h-sorted array is h \"interleaved sorted subsequences\" (where h is some number, and you look at every hth item, then those items are sorted). Look at decreasing values of h to sort the full array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each sort is implemented with only a few exchanges, assuming the relevant higher h-sorts were performed in the round prior. It's like insertion sort, but with a stride of length h instead of length 1. For example, perform a 7-sort, then 3-sort, finally a 1-sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposition for shellsort is that a $g$-sorted array remains $g$-sorted after $h$-sorting it. The mathematical proof is subtle, but shellsort is efficient because of this fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "The big question is, what increment sequence for h do you use?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...): No\n",
    "- Powers of 2 minus one (1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, ...): Maybe\n",

    "\n",
    "The proposition is that shellsort's worst case number of compares with the $3x+1$ increments is $O (N^{\\frac{3}{2}})$ (analysis is still open). In practice, the number of compares is less than that - no one has found an accurate model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shellsort is an example of a simple idea that led to substantial performance gains, and is useful in practice. It's fast, unless the array size is huge, it has a tiny, fixed footprint for code or hardware sort prototypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a simple algorithm with nontrivial performance and raises interesting questions. Does it have an asymptotic growth rate? What is the best sequence of increments? What is the average-case performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best case**: if the array is already sorted, shellsort (using $3x+1$ increment sequence) makes a linearithmic number of compares. Each successive increment value of h differs by at least a factor of 3, so there are ~$\\log_3 n$ increment values. For each increment value h, the array is already h-sorted, so it will make ~$n$ compares."

Next issue is given three points, is a turn $a \\to b \\to c$ a counterclockwise turn? You need to watch for other issues like edge cases (infinity slopes and collinearity of points), and floating point number precision."
