    "\n",
    "Another implementation is to use an array for a stack. Using an array vs. a linked list is a decision that will come up a lot. They have their pros and cons. The array would use `s[]` to store $N$ items, `push()` adds a new item at `s[N]`, and `pop()` removes the item from `s[N-1]`. One concern with using an array is you have to declare the size of it out of the gate - this places a capacity on the stack, and it overflows when $N$ exceeds that capacity.\n",

    "One method is **repeated doubling** - double the size of the array each time you hit capacity. The cost doing it this way grows with $N$. The cost of inserting the first $N$ items is $N + (2 + 4 + 8 + \\ldots + N) \\approx 3N$ - the array access per push plus $k$ array accesses to double to size $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to shrink the array? Can try doubling the size of the array when it's full, and halving when it's one-half full. Problem here is the case the client hits a full array, then does push-pop-push-pop sequence (\"thrashing\" scenario). Each operation would take time proportional to $N$. The efficient solution for this is to double the size of the array when it's full, then halve the size of the array when it's one-quarter full."
