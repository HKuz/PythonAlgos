    "# Mergesort\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mergesort** is one of two classic sorting problems (along with quicksort) that is still heavily used even 50 years later. They are critical components in the world's computational infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea for mergesort is to divide the array into two halves, recursively sort each half, then merge the two halves. Merging is the key here, given two sorted subarrays `a[lo]` to `a[mid]` and `a[mid+1]` to `a[hi]`, your goal is to replace them with a sorted subarray `a[lo]` to `a[hi]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good practice to put assertions into your code to check that what you expect is true (here that the merge function is expecting the two subarrays are actually sorted). You can enable or disable at runtime - by default they're disabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next step is to implement the **sort** part of the procedure, which recursively splits the array in half, then merges the pieces in order."

    "Mergesort is a **divide and conquer** algorithm. Good algorithms are more effective than super computers - the empirical analysis shows insertion sort would take 37 years on an average home computer for 1 billion items, where mergesort would take a week or so.\n",

    "**Computational complexity** is a framework to study efficiency of algorithms for solving a particular problem $X$. To evaluate the complexity of sorting (or any task $X$), you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model of computation: allowable operations\n",
    "- Cost model: operation count(s)\n",
    "- Upper bound: cost guarantee provided by some algorithm for $X$\n",

    "- Optimal algorithm: algorithm with best possible cost guarantee for $X$ (ideally, find one where the upper and lower bound are the same)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorting uses a decision tree as the model of computation, the cost is the number of compares, the upper bound is ~$N \\lg N$ from mergesort, and start with an unknown lower bound or optimal algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a decision tree, make a comparison (first element to second), then branch whether the first element is less than the second element or not. The **height** of the tree is the **worst-case number of compares**. So for compare-based sorting, any algorithm must use at least $\\lg (N!) \\text{ ~ } N \\lg N$ (by Stirling's formula) compares in the worst case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assume the array consists of $N$ distinct values $a_1$ through $a_N$\n",
    "- The worst case is dictated by height $h$ of the decision tree\n",

    "\\implies h \\geq \\lg (N!) \\text{ ~ } N \\lg N\n",
    "$$\n",

    "Therefore, the lower bound is ~$N \\lg N$, which is the same as the upper bound, and the optimal algorithm is mergesort. Note, mergesort is optimal with respect to the number of compares, but it's NOT optimal with respect to space usage. What you can takeaway is you shouldn't try to find fewer number of compares than mergesort, as it hits the lower bound. But you can try to find one with better space usage, while maintaining the number of compares.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that the complexity results are only for number of compares - that lower bound may not hold if the algorithm has information about the initial order of the input, the distribution of key values, or the representation of the keys. For example, you may not need $N \\lg N$ compares for a partially-ordered array or when one has duplicate keys."
