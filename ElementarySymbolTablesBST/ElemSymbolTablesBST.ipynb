    "# Elementary Symbol Tables and Binary Search Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "A **symbol table** is a key-value pair abstraction where you can *insert* a value with a specified key, and given a key, *search* for the corresponding value.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example is a domain name server lookup, where the URL is the key and the IP address is the value. There are tons of computing examples. In genomics, you can use a symbol table to find markers in a genome (the key is DNA string, the value is the known position).\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic symbol table API is to set up an **associative array abstraction**, which associates one value with each key. One simple implementation is to use an array, where the index is the key (the drawback is that the key must be an integer). The two basic operations are `put(key, value)` to insert a new key-value pair, and `get(key)` to retrieve the value associated with the given key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other operations you'll probably want include a `delete(key)` operation to remove a key-value pair, a `contains(key)` operation to return a Boolean whether a key is there or not, an `isEmpty()` one to check if the table is empty, a `size()` operation to get the number of key-value pairs, and an iterable `keys()` to return all the keys in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some general conventions are:\n",
    "- Values are not `null`\n",
    "- The `get()` method returns `null` if a key isn't present\n",
    "- The `put()` method overwrites an old value with new value if the key is already in the table\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation of `contains()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def contains(key):\n",
    "    return get(key) != None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lazy implementation of `delete()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def delete(key):\n",
    "    put(key, None)\n",
    "```"
