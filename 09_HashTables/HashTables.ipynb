    "\n",
    "A **hash table** is a data structure that implements symbol tables  with constant-time performance for core operations, provided that search keys are standard data types or simply defined. It uses different access to the data compared to other BSTs, and doesn't support ordered operations."

    "The basic idea of **hashing** is to save items in a *key-indexed table* where the index is a function of the key. A **hash function** is a method for computing the array index from the given key.\n",

    "- Collision resolution: algorithm and data structure to handle two keys that hash to the same array index\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing is a classic space-time tradeoff. With no space limitation, you use a trivial hash function with the key as the index. With no time limitation, you hash everything to the same place (use a trivial collision resolution) and do sequential search. With space and time limitations, you use hashing.\n",

    "The idealistic goal is to scramble the keys uniformly to produce a table index - it's efficiently computable and each table index is equally likely for each key.\n",
