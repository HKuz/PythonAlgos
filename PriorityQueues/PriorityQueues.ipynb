    "# Priority Queues\n",
    "\n",
    "A **priority queue** is a variant of sorting that generalizes the idea to provide a more flexible data structure, that you can then use for other applications. It doesn't remove the most recently added item (stack), the least recently added item (queue), or a random item (randomized queue), but the **largest** (or **smallest**) item. The items need to be comparable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some applications for priority queues are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Event-driven simulations (customers in a line, colliding particles)\n",
    "- Numerical computation (reducing roundoff errors)\n",
    "- Data compression (Huffman codes)\n",
    "- Graph searching (Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's algorithm)\n",
    "- Number theory (sum of powers)\n",
    "- Artificial intelligence (A\\* search)\n",
    "- Statistics (maintain largest $M$ values in a sequence)\n",
    "- Operating systems (load balancing, interrupt handling)\n",
    "- Discrete optimization (bin packing, scheduling)\n",
    "- Spam filtering (Bayesian spam filter)\n",
